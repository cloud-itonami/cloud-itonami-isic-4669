# Security Policy

This project handles waste/scrap-wholesale trading, counterparty-diligence
and transboundary-movement prior-informed-consent workflows. Treat
vulnerabilities as potentially high impact even when the demo data is
synthetic.

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real counterparty, credit or sanctions data exposure
- authorization bypass
- Waste Trading Governor bypass
- prior-informed-consent (transboundary-notification / destination-country
  consent) falsification or suppression
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in reports or exports
- tenant isolation failures

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on trade data, consent/policy enforcement or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real counterparty, credit, sanctions and transboundary-consent data
  outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
