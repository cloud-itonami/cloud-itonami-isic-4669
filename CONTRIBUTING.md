# Contributing

`cloud-itonami-isic-4669` accepts contributions to the OSS blueprint, the
Waste Trading Governor, policy tests, documentation and operator model.

## Development
This vertical is self-contained: there is no `kotoba-lang/wastetrade`
capability library. The credit-clearance / contract-on-file / prior-
informed-consent / sanctions-screening checks live directly in
`wastetrade.governor`.

```bash
kbb -M:dev:test
kbb -M:lint
kbb -M:dev:run    # demo driver
```

## Rules
- Do not commit real counterparty, credit, sanctions or transboundary-
  waste-movement (competent-authority correspondence, consent documents)
  data.
- Keep dispatch, consent-verification and settlement behind the Waste
  Trading Governor.
- Treat waste/scrap-wholesale workflows as high-risk: add tests for
  prior-informed-consent, jurisdiction, sanctions, double-actuation and
  audit logging.
- If you add or extend a jurisdiction in `wastetrade.facts/catalog`,
  `wastetrade.facts/basel-party?` or `wastetrade.facts/consent-basis`,
  cite a REAL official source -- never fabricate a jurisdiction's or a
  statute's requirements.
- If you add a waste-stream type to `wastetrade.facts/hazardous-waste-
  streams`, document the real-world reasoning (which regime treats it as
  hazardous, and since when) in `docs/business-model.md`'s honest
  coverage section -- do not add a stream type "for completeness"
  without a citation.
- Document any new business-model or operator assumption in `docs/`.

## Pull Requests
PRs should describe: what behavior changed, which policy invariant is
affected, how it was tested, whether operator or certification docs need
updates.
